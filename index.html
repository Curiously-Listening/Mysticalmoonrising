    <h2 class="header-2"><u>SPIRITUALITY MEANING?</u></h2>
    <p class="body-2">Spirituality is generally considered to be broader than any religion one might practice, as it takes into account cognitive and philosophic areas of thought as well as aspects of emotions and behavior. Some might
      describe spirituality as the
      attempt to understand one's nature or the meaning of one's existence, but spirituality is also linked to internal awareness and happiness. Many cultures and belief systems hold that a spirit is the essence of one's existence. In these cases,
      spirituality may also describe a person’s connection to others and to themselves. </p>

    <h2 class="header-3"><u>WHAT IS SPIRITUAL WELLNESS?</u></h2>
    <p class="body-3">Spiritual wellness can relate to religious belief. Some people link their spiritual wellness to the natural world. Others define it by their relationships to others. Still others may nurture spiritual wellness by
      living a fulfilling life
      according to their personal values.

      However spiritual wellness is defined, it involves a connection between people and something greater than themselves. This could be a higher power, a person’s own sense of meaning and purpose, or values or belief systems.

      Emotional and mental health, physical health, and spiritual health are all part of total wellness. The mind and body are connected, so when wellness in one area is lacking, other areas of health might be affected.

      For example, a person who develops a chronic health conditions may not feel optimistic about their health improving. If they become unable to work, enjoy hobbies, or take care of activities of daily life on their own, they may struggle to find
      meaning in life. These feelings could contribute to depression or anxiety.

  <h2 class="header-6"><u>What is the Difference Between Spiritual Counseling and Psychotherapy?</u></h2>
  <p class="body-6">The major difference lies in the fact that psychotherapy shies away from discussing religious topics.
    From the traditional psychoanalytic perspective, for example, it is frowned upon to discuss religion and for the
    therapist to reveal to the client their own spiritual persuasions (or other personal information,
    for that matter). For spiritual counselors, on the other hand, explicit discussion of religious topics
    is central to the treatment.</p>
