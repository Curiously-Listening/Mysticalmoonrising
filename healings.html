    <ul class="deff">
      <li><u>Angel Guidance</u> - A guardian angel is an angel that is assigned to protect and guide a particular person,
        group, kingdom, or country. Belief in guardian angels can be traced throughout all antiquity.</li>

      &nbsp;

      <li><u>Reiki Healing</u> - is a form of alternative medicine called energy healing. Reiki practitioners use a technique
        called palm healing or hands-on healing through which a "universal energy" is said to be transferred through the palms of
        the practitioner to the patient in order to encourage emotional or physical healing.</li>

      &nbsp;

      <li><u>Chakra Balancing</u> - Helps to bring your chakras into their natural and harmonic balance. Chakra Balancing is based on
        the ancient Indian belief in a series of seven chakras, or energy centers.
        Chakra is the Sanskrit word for wheel. These energy centers are believed to be located at specific points between the
        base of the spine and the top of the skull.</li>

      &nbsp;

      <li><u>Past Life Regression</u> - Is a technique that uses healing energy to recover what practitioners believe are memories of past lives or incarnations.
        Understanding our past lives helps us to understand our situtation(s) in our current walking life.</li>

      &nbsp;

      <li><u>Spiritual Awakening Guidance</u> - Helps you when you are no longer living in a dream world where you filter everything through your ego and focusing on the future and the past.
        Instead, you have an almost simultaneous awareness of your individual self and the connection between that and everything else.</li>

      &nbsp;

      <li><u>Spiritual Detox</u> - Your soul can become contaminated, polluted, dark, and diseased just like any part of your body that is neglected. A spiritual detox will allow you
        to become whole, heart, mind and soul. Feeling happiness in it's true form.</li>
    </ul>
